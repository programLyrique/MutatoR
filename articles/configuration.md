# Configuration

This vignette documents the options that control how
[`mutate_package()`](https://prl-prg.github.io/mutator/reference/mutate_package.md)
runs: how mutant timeouts are calibrated, which tests are selected, how
parallel workers are isolated, how to exclude code from mutation, and
how the optional coverage-guided, precise-location, and
equivalent-mutant-detection features behave. See
[`?mutate_package`](https://prl-prg.github.io/mutator/reference/mutate_package.md)
for the full argument and return-value documentation.

## Timeouts and contention in parallel mode

Each mutant is run with a wall-clock timeout; exceeding it is reported
as `HANG`. The timeout is derived from how long the package’s own test
suite takes, unless you pass `timeout_seconds` explicitly.

Because mutants run in parallel (`cores` at a time), the timeout must
account for **contention**: with many workers, each test run is slower
than it would be alone for packages that load many dependencies, or do
heavy per-mutant install work. A timeout based on a single,
*uncontended* baseline run would then fire on nearly every mutant
(leading to numerous false `HANG`s).

To avoid this,
[`mutate_package()`](https://prl-prg.github.io/mutator/reference/mutate_package.md)
first runs the baseline suite once on its own (to confirm it passes and
fail fast otherwise), then runs it `cores` times **concurrently** and
takes the slowest of those as the *contended baseline*. The timeout is
`max(contended_baseline * 1.5, 5s)`. This self-calibrates to the
machine, the chosen parallelism, and the package’s real load/compile
cost, avoiding manual tuning. Pass `timeout_seconds` to override it
entirely.

When `cores = 1`, or when forking is unavailable, the timing for the
baseline suite is used.

## CRAN mode (test selection)

By default
[`mutate_package()`](https://prl-prg.github.io/mutator/reference/mutate_package.md)
runs each mutant’s tests in **CRAN mode** (`cran = TRUE`): the
`NOT_CRAN` environment variable is set to `"false"` in the test
subprocess, so
[`testthat::skip_on_cran()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/skip.html)
and `skip_if_offline()` guards take effect and mutator runs the same
tests CRAN would. This skips the slow, flaky, or network-dependent tests
that packages mark as CRAN-skippable, which keeps mutation runs fast and
avoids spurious timeouts/kills from, e.g., tests that hit the network.

Set `cran = FALSE` to run the **full** suite instead
(`NOT_CRAN = "true"`, which is what happens by default when running
`devtools::test()`):

``` r

mutate_package("path/to/pkg", cran = FALSE)
```

This applies to both test strategies (the `testthat` strategy and the
installed-tests fallback). Note that it only affects tests the package
*explicitly* guards with `skip_on_cran()` / `skip_if_offline()`; a
package whose network test has no such guard will still run that test in
either mode.

## Fail-fast (stop at the first failing test)

A mutant is `KILLED` the instant any of the tests detects it, so running
the rest of its suite is wasted work. By default (`fail_fast = TRUE`),
each mutant’s test run **stops at the first failing test** instead of
finishing the suite, which speeds up the test-running phase (often
substantially for packages with large suites) without changing any
mutant’s verdict.

Set `fail_fast = FALSE` to run the full suite for every mutant:

``` r

mutate_package("path/to/pkg", fail_fast = FALSE)
```

This applies to the `testthat` strategy: it sets
`TESTTHAT_MAX_FAILS = 1` in the test subprocess and uses the progress
reporter, which aborts the run at the first failing `test_that()` block.
`SURVIVED` mutants are unaffected, as they have no failure to
short-circuit on, so baseline timing and timeout calibration are
unchanged. The installed-tests fallback already stops at the first
failing test *file* regardless of this flag.

## Parallel execution and isolation (`isolate`)

By default, each mutant package copy *symlinks* the unchanged
directories of the original package and only the mutated `R/` file is
materialised, so all parallel workers point at the same physical `src/`,
`tests/`, etc. This is fast, and two design choices keep it correct:

- **Compiled code is built once, not per mutant.** For the `testthat`
  strategy,
  [`pkgload::load_all()`](https://pkgload.r-lib.org/reference/load_all.html)
  reuses the baseline’s compiled `src/` since C code is never mutated.
  The `installed`strategy compiles once into a *template* library and
  installs each mutant with `--no-libs`, which never writes into `src/`.
  This prevents parallel workers from fighting over the same compiled
  objects.
- **Snapshot references are not shared.** For `testthat` packages with
  `_snaps` directories, mutator gives each mutant its own snapshot copy
  while symlinking the rest of `tests/`, so filtered or parallel runs
  cannot rewrite shared snapshot references.

The one remaining hazard is **non-hermetic tests that write files** into
a shared directory (most often `tests/`). When parallel workers’ tests
fight over the same files you can still see spurious `KILLED`/`HANG`.
Two ways to attenuate it:

1.  **Run without parallelism:** `cores = 1`. No contention, no extra
    disk, but the slowest option.

2.  **Isolate file state:** `isolate = TRUE`. Each mutant gets its own
    deep copy of `src/` and `tests/` instead of a symlink, so
    file-writing tests can’t collide:

    ``` r

    mutate_package("path/to/pkg", isolate = TRUE)
    ```

The default (`isolate = FALSE`) is fast and correct for hermetic test
suites; reach for `isolate = TRUE` (or `cores = 1`) only when a
package’s tests are not hermetic and you see parallel-only
`KILLED`/`HANG` results.

### Progress bar

When the optional
[`pbmcapply`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pbmcapply) package is
installed, the multi-core test run shows a live progress bar.

``` r

install.packages("pbmcapply")
```

## Excluding code from mutation

Not all code should be mutation-tested. Vendored/standalone files,
generated code, or deprecated paths a suite is not meant to cover will
mostly produce `SURVIVED` mutants and depress the score without telling
you anything useful. There are a few ways to exclude code.

**1. By file, at the call site, with `exclude_files`.** A character
vector of shell-style glob patterns matched against the base names of
the `.R` files in `R/`. Matching files are skipped entirely before any
mutants are generated:

``` r

mutate_package("path/to/scales", exclude_files = c("import-standalone-*"))
```

**2. In the source, with `# mutator:ignore` directives.** Place markers
in the `.R` file itself:

- `# mutator:ignore-file` anywhere in a file excludes the **whole
  file**.

- `# mutator:ignore-start` / `# mutator:ignore-end` exclude the **line
  region** between them (wrap a function to exclude it):

  ``` r

  # mutator:ignore-start
  legacy_helper <- function(x) {
    # not worth mutation-testing
    x * 2
  }
  # mutator:ignore-end
  ```

  An unmatched `-start` excludes through the end of the file.

**3. With covr’s `# nocov` annotations.** mutator also honours
[covr](https://covr.r-lib.org/)’s coverage-exclusion comments, so code
you have already marked as untested-by-design needs no separate mutator
directive:

- `# nocov start` / `# nocov end` exclude the **line region** between
  them.

- A bare `# nocov` excludes its **own line**, and may trail code:

  ``` r

  if (impossible_state) {
    stop("unreachable") # nocov
  }
  ```

**4. With a covr `.covrignore` file.** If the package root has a
`.covrignore` (covr’s file-level coverage-exclusion list), mutator reads
it too: each line is a glob expanded relative to the package root (a
matched directory expands to the files under it), and matching `R/`
files are skipped before generation, using the same mechanism covr uses.
So files you already exclude from coverage need no extra mutator
configuration.

**Granularity.** Excluding whole *files* and whole *functions* is
reliable. More fine-grained than that is not, for operator mutations: R
mostly only attaches source references to blocks
[`{}`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Paren.html), so the engine resolves an
operator mutant’s position only to its enclosing block. A region
directive inside a function therefore excludes that function’s operator
mutants as a group: you cannot single out one operator mid-function.
Line-deletion mutants *are* excluded line-precisely. In practice, wrap
whole functions, not fragments. This only affects the surviving mutant
output, which shows a larger context than necessary, and prevents the
coverage-guided test selection from being as precise as it could be. The
granularity can be improved with the optional
[`imputesrcref`](#imputesrcref) package.

## Coverage-guided test selection (`coverage_guided`)

Most mutants are settled by a small subset of the suite, and a mutant on
a line that **no test exercises** can never be killed. With
`coverage_guided = TRUE` (the default) mutator measures coverage once
with [covr](https://covr.r-lib.org/) and then, for each mutant, runs
only the test files that cover its mutated line, and skips running tests
altogether for mutants on uncovered lines (reported `SURVIVED`
immediately).

Coverage guidance applies to the `testthat` strategy only. When the
resolved strategy is the installed-tests fallback, mutator cannot
attribute coverage to test files, so it emits a warning and runs the
full suite for every mutant. Pass `coverage_guided = FALSE` to disable
the optimisation (and that warning).

``` r

# On by default; pass FALSE to run the full suite for every mutant.
mutate_package("path/to/pkg", coverage_guided = FALSE)
```

The single coverage run also serves as the baseline check (it runs the
package’s own `tests/testthat.R` harness, which fails if any test
fails), so the suite is not run twice. Selection is at the **test-file**
level, as testthat filters tests by file, and assumes the suite
deterministically exercises the code, so it changes *which* tests run
without changing a mutant’s verdict.

Requires the `covr` package. Coverage attribution (and therefore
speed-up) depends on the backend (`coverage_backend`):

- **`"record_tests"`** (default) uses covr’s `record_tests` in a single
  run and relies only on covr’s public output. Its limitation: covr
  credits a covered line to the *deepest test-directory frame* on the
  call stack, so when a test reaches package code through a function
  defined in a `helper-*.R` / `setup-*.R` file (a common pattern), covr
  attributes it to the helper, not the originating `test-*.R`. The true
  triggering test is then unknown, so mutator conservatively runs the
  **full suite** for that mutant. Packages that wrap their API in shared
  test helpers therefore see less speed-up.

- **`"per_file"`** instruments the package once and runs the suite a
  single time through a reporter that snapshots coverage per test file,
  giving **exact file-level attribution** with no helper fallback, at
  roughly the same cost as the single `record_tests` run (often faster
  overall, since more mutants get a narrowed test set). It reaches into
  covr internals, so it is opt-in:

  ``` r

  mutate_package("path/to/pkg", coverage_guided = TRUE, coverage_backend = "per_file")
  ```

Either way the pay-off is largest when the suite is big, many lines are
uncovered, and tests exercise the code directly.

## Precise mutant locations (optional `imputesrcref`)

Each reported mutant carries a source `Range:` (`start:col-end:col`).
For statement- and line-deletion mutants this is precise, but **operator
mutants** (`+`, `<`, `&&`, …) are different: R attaches no `srcref` to
nested call objects, so the engine can only report the bounds of the
*enclosing block* ([`{}`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Paren.html)),
effectively a loop body or even the whole function. A surviving
`==`-to-`!=` mutant in a 40-line function therefore points at all 40
lines.

If the optional
[`imputesrcref`](https://github.com/PRL-PRG/imputesrcref) package is
installed, `mutator` uses it to recover precise spans for many operator
mutants, typically narrowing a whole-function range down to the exact
sub-expression on a single line. It is a GitHub-only optional package
listed in `Enhances`; install it yourself to opt in:

``` r

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("PRL-PRG/imputesrcref")
```

When it is **not** installed, `mutator` behaves exactly as before
(coarser operator ranges); nothing else changes. The refinement is used
only as a read-only source-location oracle: mutant files are deparsed
from the original code and are **byte-for-byte identical** whether or
not `imputesrcref` is present, and `# mutator:ignore-*` directives keep
their function-granular semantics regardless. For best results, install
the package under test from source with parse data retained, since
`imputesrcref` reads it:

``` r

install.packages("<pkg>", INSTALL_opts = c("--with-keep.source", "--with-keep.parse.data"))
```

## Equivalent Mutant Detection

Equivalent-mutant detection calls an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions
API. Configure it in any of these ways (listed highest precedence first;
each setting is resolved independently, so they can be mixed):

1.  **Programmatically**, in your R session:

    ``` r

    set_openai_config(
      api_key  = "api-key...",
      model    = "gpt-4",
      base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1" # any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
    )
    ```

2.  **A `.openai_config` file** in the working directory (or in a
    directory you pass via `get_openai_config(dir = ...)`). It is a
    plain, human-readable file of `field: value` lines and is *parsed,
    never executed*:

        api_key: api-key...
        model: gpt-4
        base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1

    Only the given directory is consulted. Parent directories are not
    searched.

3.  **Environment variables** `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL` and
    `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

If nothing is configured, the model defaults to `gpt-4` and the base URL
to the public OpenAI API. Set `base_url` to target a self-hosted or
alternative OpenAI-compatible service (for example
`http://localhost:11434/v1`).

Enable the analysis when running package mutation tests:

``` r

mutate_package("path/to/pkg", detectEqMutants = TRUE)
```

Equivalence detection runs **before** the test suites. Because an
equivalent mutant is behaviorally identical to the original, no test can
kill it, so running its test suite is wasted work.
[`mutate_package()`](https://prl-prg.github.io/mutator/reference/mutate_package.md)
therefore analyzes every generated mutant up front and **skips the test
run** for those judged equivalent: they are recorded as survived
directly. Mutants judged `NOT_EQUIVALENT` or `DONT_KNOW` are tested as
usual. The trade-off is that the equivalence pass now covers all
mutants, not only survivors, so it makes more API calls; in exchange it
avoids the far more expensive test runs on equivalent mutants.

Mutants are analyzed in **bounded batches** (default 25 per request),
and each mutant is shown to the model as a small **unified diff** of its
edit (plus a short change label) rather than its full mutated source.
This is compact, unambiguous, and in a format LLMs read natively. When
[`mutate_package()`](https://prl-prg.github.io/mutator/reference/mutate_package.md)
runs with `cores > 1` the batches are sent **concurrently**, which (with
the bounded size) keeps the equivalence pass fast and avoids the
truncated responses that otherwise drop verdicts.

For mutants the model flags as **EQUIVALENT** (they are excluded from
the adjusted mutation score), it also returns a one-sentence **reason**,
stored as `equivalence_reason` on the mutant so the call can be audited.
No reason is requested for `NOT_EQUIVALENT`/`DONT_KNOW`, keeping
responses small.

Progress and the results summary are emitted via
[`message()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/message.html) (so they can be
silenced with
[`suppressMessages()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/message.html)). The full
prompts and model responses are not printed by default; set
`options(mutator.verbose = TRUE)` to log them.
