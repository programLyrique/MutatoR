# SURVIVED without running tests). Re-runs the SAME packages with
# coverage_guided=FALSE (full suite per mutant = ground truth) at the same SEED and

# If FALSE-score ~= TRUE-score (within CI), coverage_guided is faithful and the
# survivors are genuine. If FALSE-score is materially higher, coverage_guided was
# manufacturing false survivors.
