# mutator

## Overview

mutator is an automated mutation testing tool for the R language. It applies mutation testing principles to help developers improve test suite quality by introducing small, systematic changes (mutations) to source code and verifying if tests can detect these changes.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Mutation Testing**: Applies various mutation operators to R source code
- **AST-Based Mutation**: Uses Abstract Syntax Tree analysis for intelligent code mutations
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Runs tests in parallel for improved performance
- **Equivalent Mutant Detection**: Uses AI to identify mutants that are functionally equivalent to the original code
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides mutation scores and analysis of test suite effectiveness

## Package Structure

## Installation

```r
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("pkgload", "testthat", "httr", "jsonlite", "future", "furrr"))

# Install from GitHub (if available)
devtools::install_github("PRL-PRG/mutator")

# Or install from local source
# In R console
setwd("path/to/mutator")
devtools::install()
```

## Quick Start Guide

```r
library(mutator)

# Mutate a single file
mutants <- mutate_file("path/to/your/file.R")

# Optional: cap returned mutants by random selection
mutants <- mutate_file("path/to/your/file.R", max_mutants = 20)

# Mutate an entire package and run tests
result <- mutate_package("path/to/your/package")

# Optional: cap tested mutants across the whole package
result <- mutate_package("path/to/your/package", max_mutants = 100)

# Optional: set a fixed timeout (seconds) per mutant test run
result <- mutate_package("path/to/your/package", timeout_seconds = 60)

# Optional: control where mutant files are written
result <- mutate_package("path/to/your/package", mutation_dir = tempdir())
```

## Testing

mutator selects a package test strategy automatically:

- If `tests/testthat/` exists, mutator uses `testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")`.
- Otherwise, if `tests/` exists, mutator falls back to `tools::testInstalledPackage(..., types = "tests")` after installing each mutant with `--install-tests`.

The fallback path supports non-`testthat` layouts (for example `tinytest`-driven packages that run through `tests/` scripts), but it is slower because each mutant must be installed before tests are executed.

Each mutant test run uses a timeout. By default, mutator runs the baseline suite first and derives the per-mutant timeout as `baseline_elapsed_seconds * 1.5`. You can override this by setting `timeout_seconds` explicitly.

Mutant outcomes are reported as:

- `SURVIVED`: tests passed for the mutant
- `KILLED`: tests failed (or execution error)
- `HANG`: mutant exceeded timeout

mutator itself uses `testthat` for its own R tests and `testthat` + Catch2 for C++ tests.

- C++ tests are located in `src/test-*.cpp`
- The C++ test runner is `src/test-runner.cpp`
- C++ tests are executed from `tests/testthat/test-cpp.R` via `run_cpp_tests("mutator")`

Run the full test suite with:

```r
devtools::test()
```

## Configuration

### Equivalent Mutant Detection

Equivalent-mutant detection calls an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API.
Configure it in any of these ways (listed highest precedence first; each
setting is resolved independently, so they can be mixed):

1. **Programmatically**, in your R session:

   ```r
   set_openai_config(
     api_key  = "sk-...",
     model    = "gpt-4",
     base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1" # any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
   )
   ```

2. **A `.openai_config` file** in the working directory (or in a directory you
   pass via `get_openai_config(dir = ...)`). It is a plain, human-readable file
   of `field: value` lines and is *parsed, never executed*:

   ```
   api_key: sk-...
   model: gpt-4
   base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
   ```

   Only the given directory is consulted — parent directories are not searched.

3. **Environment variables** `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL` and
   `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

If nothing is configured, the model defaults to `gpt-4` and the base URL to the
public OpenAI API. Set `base_url` to target a self-hosted or alternative
OpenAI-compatible service (for example `http://localhost:11434/v1`).

## Mutation Operators

mutator implements a wide range of mutation operators to thoroughly test your code:
