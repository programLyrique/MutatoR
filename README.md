# mutator

## Overview

mutator is an automated mutation testing tool for the R language. It applies mutation testing principles to help developers improve test suite quality by introducing small, systematic changes (mutations) to source code and verifying if tests can detect these changes.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Mutation Testing**: Applies various mutation operators to R source code
- **AST-Based Mutation**: Uses Abstract Syntax Tree analysis for intelligent code mutations
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Runs tests in parallel for improved performance
- **Equivalent Mutant Detection**: Uses AI to identify mutants that are functionally equivalent to the original code
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides mutation scores and analysis of test suite effectiveness

## Quick Start Guide

```r
library(mutator)

# Mutate a single file
mutants <- mutate_file("path/to/your/file.R")

# Optional: cap returned mutants by random selection
mutants <- mutate_file("path/to/your/file.R", max_mutants = 20)

# Mutate an entire package and run tests
result <- mutate_package("path/to/your/package")

# Optional: cap tested mutants across the whole package
result <- mutate_package("path/to/your/package", max_mutants = 100)

# Optional: set a fixed timeout (seconds) per mutant test run
result <- mutate_package("path/to/your/package", timeout_seconds = 60)

# Optional: control where mutant files are written
result <- mutate_package("path/to/your/package", mutation_dir = tempdir())
```

## Testing

mutator selects a package test strategy automatically:

- If `tests/testthat/` exists, mutator loads the mutant in-process with `pkgload::load_all()` and runs its tests the way the package's own `tests/testthat.R` harness does — forwarding the same arguments (notably any `filter`) that the harness passes to `testthat::test_check()` to `testthat::test_dir()`. This means mutator runs exactly the tests the package author (and `R CMD check`) run, without paying for an install per mutant.
- Otherwise, if `tests/` exists, mutator falls back to `tools::testInstalledPackage(..., types = "tests")` after installing each mutant with `--install-tests`.

The fallback path supports non-`testthat` layouts (for example `tinytest`-driven packages that run through `tests/` scripts), but it is slower because each mutant must be installed before tests are executed.

Each mutant test run uses a timeout. By default, mutator runs the baseline suite first and derives the per-mutant timeout as `baseline_elapsed_seconds * 1.5`. You can override this by setting `timeout_seconds` explicitly.

Mutant outcomes are reported as:

- `SURVIVED`: tests passed for the mutant
- `KILLED`: tests failed (or execution error)
- `HANG`: mutant exceeded timeout

mutator itself uses `testthat` for its own R tests and `testthat` + Catch2 for C++ tests.

- C++ tests are located in `src/test-*.cpp`
- The C++ test runner is `src/test-runner.cpp`
- C++ tests are executed from `tests/testthat/test-cpp.R` via `run_cpp_tests("mutator")`

Run the full test suite with:

```r
devtools::test()
```

## Configuration

### Timeouts and the contended baseline

Each mutant is run with a wall-clock timeout; exceeding it is reported as
`HANG`. The timeout is derived from how long the package's own test suite takes,
unless you pass `timeout_seconds` explicitly.

Because mutants run in parallel (`cores` at a time), the timeout must account
for **contention**: with many workers, each test run is slower than it would be
alone — for packages that load many dependencies, or recompile C code on every
`R CMD INSTALL`, dramatically so. A timeout based on a single, *uncontended*
baseline run would then fire on nearly every mutant (a wave of false `HANG`s).

To avoid this, `mutate_package()` first runs the baseline suite once on its own
(to confirm it passes and fail fast otherwise), then runs it `cores` times
**concurrently** and takes the slowest of those as the *contended baseline*. The
timeout is `max(contended_baseline * 1.5, 5s)`. This self-calibrates to the
machine, the chosen parallelism, and the package's real load/compile cost — no
manual tuning. Pass `timeout_seconds` to override it entirely. (When `cores = 1`,
or when forking is unavailable, the solo baseline is used.)

### CRAN mode (test selection)

By default `mutate_package()` runs each mutant's tests in **CRAN mode**
(`cran = TRUE`): the `NOT_CRAN` environment variable is set to `"false"` in the
test subprocess, so `testthat::skip_on_cran()` and `skip_if_offline()` guards
take effect and mutator runs the same tests CRAN would. This skips the slow,
flaky, or network-dependent tests that packages mark as CRAN-skippable — which
keeps mutation runs fast and avoids spurious timeouts/kills from, e.g., tests
that hit the network.

Set `cran = FALSE` to run the **full** suite instead (`NOT_CRAN = "true"`, the
behaviour of `devtools::test()`):

```r
mutate_package("path/to/pkg", cran = FALSE)
```

This applies to both test strategies (the `testthat` strategy and the
installed-tests fallback). Note that it only affects tests the package
*explicitly* guards with `skip_on_cran()` / `skip_if_offline()`; a package whose
network test has no such guard will still run that test in either mode.

### Fail-fast (stop at the first failing test)

A mutant is `KILLED` the instant any one test detects it, so running the rest of
its suite is wasted work. By default (`fail_fast = TRUE`) each mutant's test run
**stops at the first failing test** instead of finishing the suite, which speeds
up the test-running phase — often substantially for packages with large suites —
without changing any mutant's verdict (the early-aborted run still reports the
failure, so the mutant is still `KILLED`).

Set `fail_fast = FALSE` to run the full suite for every mutant:

```r
mutate_package("path/to/pkg", fail_fast = FALSE)
```

This applies to the `testthat` strategy (it sets `TESTTHAT_MAX_FAILS = 1` in the
test subprocess and uses the progress reporter, which aborts the run at the first
failing `test_that()` block). `SURVIVED` mutants are unaffected — they have no
failure to short-circuit on — so baseline timing and timeout calibration are
unchanged. The installed-tests fallback already stops at the first failing test
*file* regardless of this flag.

### Equivalent Mutant Detection

Equivalent-mutant detection calls an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API.
Configure it in any of these ways (listed highest precedence first; each
setting is resolved independently, so they can be mixed):

1. **Programmatically**, in your R session:

   ```r
   set_openai_config(
     api_key  = "sk-...",
     model    = "gpt-4",
     base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1" # any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
   )
   ```

2. **A `.openai_config` file** in the working directory (or in a directory you
   pass via `get_openai_config(dir = ...)`). It is a plain, human-readable file
   of `field: value` lines and is *parsed, never executed*:

   ```
   api_key: sk-...
   model: gpt-4
   base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
   ```

   Only the given directory is consulted — parent directories are not searched.

3. **Environment variables** `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL` and
   `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

If nothing is configured, the model defaults to `gpt-4` and the base URL to the
public OpenAI API. Set `base_url` to target a self-hosted or alternative
OpenAI-compatible service (for example `http://localhost:11434/v1`).

Survived mutants are analyzed in **bounded batches** (default 25 per request),
and each mutant is shown to the model as a small **unified diff** of its edit
(plus a short change label) rather than its full mutated source — compact,
unambiguous, and in a format LLMs read natively. When `mutate_package()` runs
with `cores > 1` the batches are sent **concurrently**, which (with the bounded
size) keeps the equivalence pass fast and avoids the truncated responses that
otherwise drop verdicts.

For mutants the model flags as **EQUIVALENT** (the rare, high-stakes calls — they
are excluded from the adjusted mutation score), it also returns a one-sentence
**reason**, stored as `equivalence_reason` on the mutant so the call can be
audited. No reason is requested for `NOT_EQUIVALENT`/`DONT_KNOW`, keeping
responses small.

Progress and the results summary are emitted via `message()` (so they can be
silenced with `suppressMessages()`). The full prompts and model responses are
not printed by default; set `options(mutator.verbose = TRUE)` to log them.

## Mutation Operators

mutator implements a wide range of mutation operators to thoroughly test your code:
