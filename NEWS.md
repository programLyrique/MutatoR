# mutator 0.2.2

- The reusable GitHub Actions workflow now installs mutator from CRAN by
  default, instead of from the tip of the GitHub repository. A new
  `mutator-source` input selects `cran` (default), `r-universe`, `github`, or
  `local` (mutator is the package under test). When CRAN or r-universe cannot
  provide the package, the workflow falls back to `PRL-PRG/mutator` at the tag
  given by the new `mutator-ref` input, which defaults to the release the
  workflow is versioned with; set `mutator-fallback: false` to fail instead. The
  existing `mutator-spec` input still accepts a raw pak spec and now overrides
  `mutator-source`; it no longer defaults to GitHub.

# mutator 0.2.1

This release addresses feedback received from CRAN during the review of the
initial submission:

- Removed the default output directory from `mutate_file()`, so callers must
  explicitly choose where mutant files are written.
- Restored the caller's working directory immediately with `on.exit()` in all
  package test-runner and coverage code paths that temporarily change it.

It also improves Windows support:

- Mutant package copies now link directories with junctions (`Sys.junction()`)
  rather than symbolic links on Windows, which `unlink()` cannot remove; this
  avoids leftover reparse points and the accompanying `R CMD check` warnings.

# mutator 0.2.0

- Added first-class `tinytest` support. A package with an `inst/tinytest`
  directory is now auto-detected and its mutants are run in-process with
  `pkgload::load_all()` and `tinytest::run_test_dir()`, without an install per
  mutant, including coverage-guided test selection.
- Added a `strategy` argument to `mutate_package()` to override test-framework
  auto-detection. Accepted values are `"auto"` (the default), `"testthat"`,
  `"tinytest"`, `"tinytest-installed"`, and `"installed"`.
- Added a `tinytest-installed` strategy that installs each mutant and runs
  `tinytest::test_package()`. It is a fallback for packages whose in-process
  load diverges from an installed copy and unlike the generic
  installed-tests fallback it still supports coverage-guided selection.
- Reworked the README and configuration vignette, documenting how the test
  strategy is selected and when to override it.
- Fixed the `per_file` coverage backend to forward the package's
  `tests/testthat.R` harness arguments (notably any `filter`) to
  `testthat::test_dir()`, matching the `record_tests` backend.

# mutator 0.1.1

- Fixed coverage-guided baseline runs for packages with native code by compiling
  native sources before mutant execution.
- Fixed the `record_tests` coverage backend so it forwards the selected CRAN
  mode consistently.
- Updated the reusable GitHub Actions workflow to install `imputesrcref` from
  its default branch, replacing the removed development-branch reference.
- Expanded mutation-system coverage across execution modes and raised mutator's
  own test coverage above 90% without adding slow integration tests.

# mutator 0.1.0

- Initial CRAN release candidate.
